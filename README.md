### :closed_lock_with_key: Optimized security
Being meticulously optimized for speed and memory footprint, µWebSockets is fast enough to do encrypted TLS 1.3 messaging quicker than most alternative servers can do even unencrypted, cleartext messaging<sup><a href="https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/tree/master/benchmarks#benchmark-driven-development">3</a></sup>.

Furthermore, we partake in Google's OSS-Fuzz with a ~95% daily fuzzing coverage<sup><a href="https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/blob/master/misc/Screenshot_20210915-004009.png?raw=true">4</a></sup> with no sanitizer issues. LGTM scores us flawless A+ from having zero CodeQL alerts and we compile with pedantic warning levels.


### :arrow_forward: Rapid scripting
µWebSockets is written entirely in C & C++ but has a seamless integration for Node.js backends. This allows for rapid scripting of powerful apps, using widespread competence. See <a href="https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js">µWebSockets.js</a>.

### :crossed_swords: Battle proven
We've been fully standards compliant with a perfect Autobahn|Testsuite score since 2016<sup><a href="https://unetworking.github.io/uWebSockets.js/report.pdf">2</a></sup>. µWebSockets powers many of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world, handling trade volumes of multiple billions of USD every day. If you trade crypto, chances are you do so via µWebSockets.

### :battery: Batteries included
Designed around a convenient URL router with wildcard & parameter support - paired with efficient pub/sub features inspired by MQTT. µWebSockets should be the obvious, complete starting point for any real-time web project with high demands.

Start building your Http & WebSocket apps in a swift; <a href="https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/blob/master/misc/READMORE.md">read the user manual</a> and <a href="https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/tree/master/examples">see examples</a>. You can browse our <a href="https://unetworking.github.io/uWebSockets.js/generated/">TypeDoc</a> for a quick overview.

```c++
uWS::SSLApp({

    /* There are tons of SSL options, see uSockets */
    .cert_file_name = "cert.pem",
    .key_file_name = "key.pem"
    
}).get("/hello", [](auto *res, auto *req) {

    /* You can efficiently stream huge files too */
    res->writeHeader("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")->end("Hello HTTP!");
    
}).ws<UserData>("/*", {

    /* Just a few of the available handlers */
    .open = [](auto *ws) {
        /* MQTT syntax */
        ws->subscribe("sensors/+/house");
    },
    .message = [](auto *ws, std::string_view message, uWS::OpCode opCode) {
        ws->send(message, opCode);
    }
    
}).listen(9001, [](auto *listenSocket) {

    if (listenSocket) {
        std::cout << "Listening on port " << 9001 << std::endl;
    }
    
}).run();
```
### :briefcase: Commercially supported
<a href="https://github.com/uNetworking">uNetworking AB</a> is a Swedish consulting & contracting company dealing with anything related to µWebSockets; development, support and customer success.

Don't hesitate <a href="mailto:alexhultman@gmail.com">sending a mail</a> if you're building something large, in need of advice or having other business inquiries in mind. We'll figure out what's best for both parties and make sure you're not stepping into one of the many common pitfalls.

Special thanks to BitMEX, Bitfinex, Google, Coinbase, Bitwyre and deepstreamHub for allowing the project itself to thrive on GitHub since 2016 - this project would not be possible without these beautiful companies.

### :wrench: Customizable architecture
µWebSockets builds on <a href="https://github.com/uNetworking/uSockets">µSockets</a>, a foundation library implementing eventing, networking and cryptography in three different layers. Every layer has multiple implementations and you control the compiled composition with flags. There are currently five event-loop integrations; libuv, ASIO, GCD and raw epoll/kqueue.

In a nutshell:

* `WITH_WOLFSSL=1 WITH_LIBUV=1 make examples` builds examples utilizing WolfSSL and libuv
* `WITH_OPENSSL=1 make examples` builds examples utilizing OpenSSL and the native kernel

See µSockets for an up-to-date list of flags and a more detailed explanation.
